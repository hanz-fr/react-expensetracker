# Quick Preview
Expense Tracker will store, and calculate how much expenses you have in a year, and in a month. Currently, you can only store your expenses in this year (2023) and previous 3 years (2022, 2021, 2020). This project is built using react and third-party plugins that helps a lot, making Expense Tracker even better. Expense Tracker is inspired by instrument-like UI, so the look's might be quiet different and not what you expected like most regular website you've seen.

This project will always be updated, considering there are still many features that haven't been implemented and there's something that needs to be fixed. In the future, I'll release an improved version of this project, ExpenseTracker+. It'll have even more rich features than the regular Expense Tracker. Hopefully, it can be done soon after I fully completed the standard one.

Feel free to use, modify, or even contribute (if you want) to make Expense Tracker become more perfect.
